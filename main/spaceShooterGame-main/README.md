Space Shooter Game

An arcade-style space shooter built with the **Defold Game Engine**.

Gameplay
- Control a spaceship and collect as many stars as possible.
- Avoid bad stars that reduce your score.
- If your score reaches 0, the game ends with a "Game Over" screen.  
- Click anywhere to restart from 0.

Scoring
- Normal stars are yellow: +1000 points
- Bonus stars are green: +5000 points
- Bad stars are green with a red 'X' in the middle: -2000 points
- Bad stars also move in a wave-like motion, making them harder to dodge.

Controls
- 'Up Arrow Key' moves spaceship up  
- 'Down Arrow Key' moves spaceship down  
- Can only move up and down, not left and right.
